% Stichpunkte:
% - You refer to the volume measurements to analyze quality.
% - You compare volume/fluffiness before and after optimization.
% - Do not repeat the formula or measurement steps here.

The quality of the cotton candy produced in each run was assessed using the previously introduced weight and volume-based metrics. In particular, changes in product volume and the derived Fluffiness Index were analyzed across multiple runs to evaluate whether the digital twin contributed to a measurable improvement in output quality.


/section{Product Output Consistency}
Like we saw in the research, the less the max pressure of the sugar the better quality the cotton candy.

the smaller the cc, the less quality (when count is )

After count >= 10 its a bad score (too small)
