# Cotton Candy Quality Analysis - Full Dataset Summary Report (DT-2208)

## Analysis Overview

This comprehensive analysis examined the **FULL** cotton candy production dataset with **29 features** (compared to 10 in the basic analysis) to identify the most important parameters for achieving optimal quality scores.

## Dataset Comparison

### Extended Dataset (DT-2208) vs Basic Dataset (DT-2108)
- **Features**: 29 vs 10 (190% more features)
- **Feature Categories**:
  - Process Parameters: wait_time, cook_time, duration_cc_flow, etc.
  - Environmental Baseline: Multiple temperature/humidity sensors
  - Pre-Process Environment: Before turn-on conditions
  - Weight Measurements: Various weight/mass measurements
  - System State: Iteration tracking, maintenance cycles
  - Quality Metrics: Extended quality assessments

## Key Findings

### 1. Extended Data Exploration
